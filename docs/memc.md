# Description

This module extends the standard [memcached
module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_memcached_module.html) to
support almost the whole [memcached ascii
protocol](http://code.sixapart.com/svn/memcached/trunk/server/doc/protocol.txt).

It allows you to define a custom
[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) interface to your memcached
servers or access memcached in a very efficient way from within the
nginx server by means of subrequests or [independent fake
requests](http://github.com/srlindsay/nginx-independent-subrequest).

This module is not supposed to be merged into the Nginx core because
I've used [Ragel](http://www.complang.org/ragel/) to generate the
memcached response parsers (in C) for joy :)

If you are going to use this module to cache location responses out of
the box, try
[srcache-nginx-module](http://github.com/openresty/srcache-nginx-module)
with this module to achieve that.

When used in conjunction with
[lua-nginx-module](http://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module), it is
recommended to use the
[lua-resty-memcached](http://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-memcached)
library instead of this module though, because the former is much more
flexible and memory-efficient.


## Keep-alive connections to memcached servers

You need
[HttpUpstreamKeepaliveModule](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamKeepaliveModule)
together with this module for keep-alive TCP connections to your backend
memcached servers.

Here's a sample configuration:

``` nginx

   http {
     upstream backend {
       server 127.0.0.1:11211;

       # a pool with at most 1024 connections
       # and do not distinguish the servers:
       keepalive 1024;
     }

     server {
         ...
         location /memc {
             set $memc_cmd get;
             set $memc_key $arg_key;
             memc_pass backend;
         }
     }
   }
```


## How it works

It implements the memcached TCP protocol all by itself, based upon the
`upstream` mechanism. Everything involving I/O is non-blocking.

The module itself does not keep TCP connections to the upstream
memcached servers across requests, just like other upstream modules. For
a working solution, see section [Keep-alive connections to memcached
servers](#keep-alive-connections-to-memcached-servers).


# Memcached commands supported

The memcached storage commands
[set](#set-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value),
[add](#add-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value),
[replace](#replace-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value),
[prepend](#prepend-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value), and
[append](#append-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value) uses the
`$memc_key` as the key, `$memc_exptime` as the expiration time (or
delay) (defaults to 0), `$memc_flags` as the flags (defaults to 0), to
build the corresponding memcached queries.

If `$memc_value` is not defined at all, then the request body will be
used as the value of the `$memc_value` except for the
[incr](#incr-memc_key-memc_value) and [decr](#decr-memc_key-memc_value)
commands. Note that if `$memc_value` is defined as an empty string
(`""`), that empty string will still be used as the value as is.

The following memcached commands have been implemented and tested (with
their parameters marked by corresponding nginx variables defined by this
module):


## get $memc\_key

Retrieves the value using a key.

``` nginx

   location /foo {
       set $memc_cmd 'get';
       set $memc_key 'my_key';

       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;

       add_header X-Memc-Flags $memc_flags;
   }
```

Returns `200 OK` with the value put into the response body if the key is
found, or `404 Not Found` otherwise. The `flags` number will be set into
the `$memc_flags` variable so it's often desired to put that info into
the response headers by means of the standard [add\_header
directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html#add_header).

It returns `502` for `ERROR`, `CLIENT_ERROR`, or `SERVER_ERROR`.


## set $memc\_key $memc\_flags $memc\_exptime $memc\_value

To use the request body as the memcached value, just avoid setting the
`$memc_value` variable:

``` nginx

   # POST /foo
   # my value...
   location /foo {
       set $memc_cmd 'set';
       set $memc_key 'my_key';
       set $memc_flags 12345;
       set $memc_exptime 24;

       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
   }
```

Or let the `$memc_value` hold the value:

``` nginx

   location /foo {
       set $memc_cmd 'set';
       set $memc_key 'my_key';
       set $memc_flags 12345;
       set $memc_exptime 24;
       set $memc_value 'my_value';

       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
   }
```

Returns `201 Created` if the upstream memcached server replies `STORED`,
`200` for `NOT_STORED`, `404` for `NOT_FOUND`, `502` for `ERROR`,
`CLIENT_ERROR`, or `SERVER_ERROR`.

The original memcached responses are returned as the response body
except for `404 NOT FOUND`.


## add $memc\_key $memc\_flags $memc\_exptime $memc\_value

Similar to the [set
command](#set-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value).


## replace $memc\_key $memc\_flags $memc\_exptime $memc\_value

Similar to the [set
command](#set-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value).


## append $memc\_key $memc\_flags $memc\_exptime $memc\_value

Similar to the [set
command](#set-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value).

Note that at least memcached version 1.2.2 does not support the "append"
and "prepend" commands. At least 1.2.4 and later versions seem to
supports these two commands.


## prepend $memc\_key $memc\_flags $memc\_exptime $memc\_value

Similar to the [append
command](#append-memc_key-memc_flags-memc_exptime-memc_value).


## delete $memc\_key

Deletes the memcached entry using a key.

``` nginx

   location /foo
       set $memc_cmd delete;
       set $memc_key my_key;

       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
   }
```

Returns `200 OK` if deleted successfully, `404 Not Found` for
`NOT_FOUND`, or `502` for `ERROR`, `CLIENT_ERROR`, or `SERVER_ERROR`.

The original memcached responses are returned as the response body
except for `404 NOT FOUND`.


## delete $memc\_key $memc\_exptime

Similar to the [delete $memc\_key](#delete-memc_key) command except it
accepts an optional `expiration` time specified by the `$memc_exptime`
variable.

This command is no longer available in the latest memcached version
1.4.4.


## incr $memc\_key $memc\_value

Increments the existing value of `$memc_key` by the amount specified by
`$memc_value`:

``` nginx

   location /foo {
       set $memc_cmd incr;
       set $memc_key my_key;
       set $memc_value 2;
       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
   }
```

In the preceding example, every time we access `/foo` will cause the
value of `my_key` increments by `2`.

Returns `200 OK` with the new value associated with that key as the
response body if successful, or `404 Not Found` if the key is not found.

It returns `502` for `ERROR`, `CLIENT_ERROR`, or `SERVER_ERROR`.


## decr $memc\_key $memc\_value

Similar to [incr $memc\_key $memc\_value](#incr-memc_key-memc_value).


## flush\_all

Mark all the keys on the memcached server as expired:

``` nginx

   location /foo {
       set $memc_cmd flush_all;
       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
   }
```


## flush\_all $memc\_exptime

Just like [flush\_all](#flush_all) but also accepts an expiration time
specified by the `$memc_exptime` variable.


## stats

Causes the memcached server to output general-purpose statistics and
settings

``` nginx

   location /foo {
       set $memc_cmd stats;
       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
   }
```

Returns `200 OK` if the request succeeds, or 502 for `ERROR`,
`CLIENT_ERROR`, or `SERVER_ERROR`.

The raw `stats` command output from the upstream memcached server will
be put into the response body.


## version

Queries the memcached server's version number:

``` nginx

   location /foo {
       set $memc_cmd version;
       memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;
   }
```

Returns `200 OK` if the request succeeds, or 502 for `ERROR`,
`CLIENT_ERROR`, or `SERVER_ERROR`.

The raw `version` command output from the upstream memcached server will
be put into the response body.


# Directives

All the standard [memcached
module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_memcached_module.html)
directives in nginx 0.8.28 are directly inherited, with the `memcached_`
prefixes replaced by `memc_`. For example, the `memcached_pass`
directive is spelled `memc_pass`.

Here we only document the most important two directives (the latter is a
new directive introduced by this module).


## memc\_pass

**syntax:** *memc\_pass \<memcached server IP address\>:\<memcached
server port\>*

**syntax:** *memc\_pass \<memcached server hostname\>:\<memcached server
port\>*

**syntax:** *memc\_pass \<upstream\_backend\_name\>*

**syntax:** *memc\_pass unix:\<path\_to\_unix\_domain\_socket\>*

**default:** *none*

**context:** *http, server, location, if*

**phase:** *content*

Specify the memcached server backend.


## memc\_cmds\_allowed

**syntax:** *memc\_cmds\_allowed \<cmd\>...*

**default:** *none*

**context:** *http, server, location, if*

Lists memcached commands that are allowed to access. By default, all the
memcached commands supported by this module are accessible. An example
is

``` nginx

    location /foo {
        set $memc_cmd $arg_cmd;
        set $memc_key $arg_key;
        set $memc_value $arg_val;

        memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11211;

        memc_cmds_allowed get;
    }
```


## memc\_flags\_to\_last\_modified

**syntax:** *memc\_flags\_to\_last\_modified on|off*

**default:** *off*

**context:** *http, server, location, if*

Read the memcached flags as epoch seconds and set it as the value of the
`Last-Modified` header. For conditional GET, it will signal nginx to
return `304 Not Modified` response to save bandwidth.


## memc\_connect\_timeout

**syntax:** *memc\_connect\_timeout \<time\>*

**default:** *60s*

**context:** *http, server, location*

The timeout for connecting to the memcached server, in seconds by
default.

It's wise to always explicitly specify the time unit to avoid confusion.
Time units supported are "s"(seconds), "ms"(milliseconds), "y"(years),
"M"(months), "w"(weeks), "d"(days), "h"(hours), and "m"(minutes).

This time must be less than 597 hours.


## memc\_send\_timeout

**syntax:** *memc\_send\_timeout \<time\>*

**default:** *60s*

**context:** *http, server, location*

The timeout for sending TCP requests to the memcached server, in seconds
by default.

It is wise to always explicitly specify the time unit to avoid
confusion. Time units supported are "s"(seconds), "ms"(milliseconds),
"y"(years), "M"(months), "w"(weeks), "d"(days), "h"(hours), and
"m"(minutes).

This time must be less than 597 hours.


## memc\_read\_timeout

**syntax:** *memc\_read\_timeout \<time\>*

**default:** *60s*

**context:** *http, server, location*

The timeout for reading TCP responses from the memcached server, in
seconds by default.

It's wise to always explicitly specify the time unit to avoid confusion.
Time units supported are "s"(seconds), "ms"(milliseconds), "y"(years),
"M"(months), "w"(weeks), "d"(days), "h"(hours), and "m"(minutes).

This time must be less than 597 hours.


## memc\_buffer\_size

**syntax:** *memc\_buffer\_size \<size\>*

**default:** *4k/8k*

**context:** *http, server, location*

This buffer size is used for the memory buffer to hold

  - the complete response for memcached commands other than `get`,
  - the complete response header (i.e., the first line of the response)
    for the `get` memcached command.

This default size is the page size, may be `4k` or `8k`.


## memc\_ignore\_client\_abort

**syntax:** *memc\_ignore\_client\_abort on|off*

**default:** *off*

**context:** *location*

Determines whether the connection with a memcache server should be
closed when a client closes a connection without waiting for a response.

This directive was first added in the `v0.14` release.

# Report Bugs

Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

1.  create a ticket on the [issue tracking
    interface](http://github.com/openresty/memc-nginx-module/issues)
    provided by GitHub,
2.  or send a bug report or even patches to the [nginx mailing
    list](http://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx).

# Changes

OpenResty bundle's change logs:

# Test Suite

This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The [test
cases](http://github.com/openresty/memc-nginx-module/tree/master/t/) are
[declarative](http://github.com/openresty/memc-nginx-module/blob/master/t/storage.t)
too. Thanks to the
[Test::Base](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base) module in the
Perl world.

To run it on your side:

``` bash

 $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-memc-module:$PATH prove -r t
```

You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

Either [LWP::UserAgent](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::UserAgent)
or [IO::Socket](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::Socket) is used by
the [test
scaffold](http://github.com/openresty/memc-nginx-module/blob/master/test/lib/Test/Nginx/LWP.pm).

Because a single nginx server (by default, `localhost:1984`) is used
across all the test scripts (`.t` files), it's meaningless to run the
test suite in parallel by specifying `-jN` when invoking the `prove`
utility.

You should also keep a memcached server listening on the `11211` port at
localhost before running the test suite.

Some parts of the test suite requires modules
[rewrite](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html)
and [echo](http://github.com/openresty/echo-nginx-module) to be enabled
as well when building Nginx.


# TODO

  - add support for the memcached commands `cas`, `gets` and `stats
    $memc_value`.
  - add support for the `noreply` option.
