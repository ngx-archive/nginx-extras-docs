# _nbr_: NGINX Brotli dynamic modules


## Installation

### CentOS/RHEL 6, 7, 8 or Amazon Linux 2

```bash
yum -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-latest.rpm
yum -y install nginx-module-nbr
```

Enable the module by adding the following at the top of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

    load_module modules/ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so;
    load_module modules/ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so;

<hr />

Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that
compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77
algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a
compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate
but offers more dense compression.

ngx\_brotli is a set of two nginx modules:

  - ngx\_brotli filter module - used to compress responses on-the-fly,
  - ngx\_brotli static module - used to serve pre-compressed files.

[![TravisCI Build

## Status

Both Brotli library and nginx module are under active development.

## Configuration directives

### `brotli_static`

  - **syntax**: `brotli_static on|off|always`
  - **default**: `off`
  - **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Enables or disables checking of the existence of pre-compressed files
with`.br` extension. With the `always` value, pre-compressed file is
used in all cases, without checking if the client supports it.

### `brotli`

  - **syntax**: `brotli on|off`
  - **default**: `off`
  - **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`, `if`

Enables or disables on-the-fly compression of responses.

### `brotli_types`

  - **syntax**: `brotli_types <mime_type> [..]`
  - **default**: `text/html`
  - **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Enables on-the-fly compression of responses for the specified MIME types
in addition to `text/html`. The special value `*` matches any MIME type.
Responses with the `text/html` MIME type are always compressed.

### `brotli_buffers`

  - **syntax**: `brotli_buffers <number> <size>`
  - **default**: `32 4k|16 8k`
  - **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

**Deprecated**, ignored.

### `brotli_comp_level`

  - **syntax**: `brotli_comp_level <level>`
  - **default**: `6`
  - **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Sets on-the-fly compression Brotli quality (compression) `level`.
Acceptable values are in the range from `0` to `11`.

### `brotli_window`

  - **syntax**: `brotli_window <size>`
  - **default**: `512k`
  - **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Sets Brotli window `size`. Acceptable values are `1k`, `2k`, `4k`, `8k`,
`16k`, `32k`, `64k`, `128k`, `256k`, `512k`, `1m`, `2m`, `4m`, `8m` and
`16m`.

### `brotli_min_length`

  - **syntax**: `brotli_min_length <length>`
  - **default**: `20`
  - **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Sets the minimum `length` of a response that will be compressed. The
length is determined only from the `Content-Length` response header
field.

## Variables

### `$brotli_ratio`

Achieved compression ratio, computed as the ratio between the original
and compressed response sizes.

## Sample configuration
