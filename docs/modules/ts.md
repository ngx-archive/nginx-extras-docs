## Features

  - receives MPEG-TS over HTTP
  - produces and manages live
    [HLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23)
  - produces and manages live
    [MPEG-DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)

## static module
$ ./configure --add-module=/path/to/nginx-ts-module

## dynamic module
$ ./configure --add-dynamic-module=/path/to/nginx-ts-module
```

## Directives

### ts

|            |          |
| ---------- | -------- |
| *Syntax:*  | `ts`     |
| *Context:* | location |

Sets up a live MPEG-TS handler for the location. This directive is
**required** for HLS or MPEG-DASH generation.

The last URI component is used as a stream name. For example, if the URI
is `/foo/bar/baz`, the stream name is `baz`.

A simple way to stream MPEG-TS over HTTP is by running `ffmpeg`:

``` sourceCode bash
$ ffmpeg ... -f mpegts http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo
```

By default, HTTP request body size is limited in nginx. To enable live
streaming without size limitation, use the directive
`client_max_body_size 0`.

### ts\_hls

|            |                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Syntax:*  | `ts_hls path=PATH [segment=MIN[:MAX]] [segments=NUMBER] [max_size=SIZE] [noclean]` |
| *Context:* | location                                                                           |

Enables generating live HLS in the location. The `PATH` parameter
specifies a directory where HLS playlist and segment files will be
created. The directory is created if missing. For every publshed stream
a subdirectory with the stream name is created under the `PATH`
directory. The HLS playlist file created in the stream subdirectory is
named `index.m3u8`. A path handler is installed to watch files in the
directory. The old files in the directory are automatically deleted once
they get old enough and are not supposed to be accessed by clients
anymore. It is not allowed to reuse the path in other `ts_hls` or
`ts_dash` directives.

The `segment` parameter specifies minimum and maximum segment durations.
If the stream has video, segments are started at video key frames. If a
key frame does not appear within `MAX` duration, the segment is
truncated. The default value for minimum segment duration is 5 seconds.
If unspecified, maximum segment duration is set to be twice as much as
the minimum.

The `segments` parameter specifies the maximum number of segments in a
playlist. As new segments are added to the playlist, the oldest segments
are removed from it.

The `max_size` parameter specifies the maximum size of a segment. A
segment is truncated once it reaches this size.

The `noclean` parameter indicates that the old files (segments and the
playlist) should not be automatically deleted from disk.

Example:

    location / {
        ts;
        ts_hls path=/var/hls segment=10s;
    }

### ts\_dash

|            |                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Syntax:*  | `ts_dash path=PATH [segment=MIN[:MAX]] [segments=NUMBER] [max_size=SIZE] [noclean]` |
| *Context:* | location                                                                            |

Enables generating live MPEG-DASH in the location. The `PATH` parameter
specifies a directory where MPEG-DASH manifest and segment files will be
created. The directory is created if missing. For every publshed stream
a subdirectory with the stream name is created under the `PATH`
directory. The MPEG-DASH manifest file created in the stream
subdirectory is named `index.mpd`. A path handler is installed to watch
files in the directory. The old files in the directory are automatically
deleted once they get old enough and are not supposed to be accessed by
clients anymore. It is not allowed to reuse the path in other `ts_hls`
or `ts_dash` directives.

The `segment` parameter specifies minimum and maximum segment durations.
If the stream has video, segments are started at video key frames. If a
key frame does not appear within `MAX` duration, the segment is
truncated. The default value for minimum segment duration is 5 seconds.
If unspecified, maximum segment duration is set to be twice as much as
the minimum.

> When setting an explicit value for the `MAX` parameter, the following
> note should be taken into account. If the next segment is shorter than
> the previous one by a factor more that two,
> [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) can end up
> in a busy cycle requesting the second segment over and over again.

The `segments` parameter specifies the maximum number of segments in a
manifest. As new segments are added to the manifest, the oldest segments
are removed from it.

The `max_size` parameter specifies the maximum size of a segment. A
segment is truncated once it reaches this size.

The `noclean` parameter indicates that the old files (segments and the
manifest) should not be automatically deleted from disk.

Example:

    location / {
        ts;
        ts_dash path=/var/hls segment=10s;
    }

## Example

nginx.conf:

    # nginx.conf
    
    events {
    }
    
    http {
        server {
            listen 8000;
    
            location / {
                root html;
            }
    
            location /publish/ {
                ts;
                ts_hls path=/var/media/hls segment=10s;
                ts_dash path=/var/media/dash segment=10s;
    
                client_max_body_size 0;
            }
    
            location /play/ {
                types {
                    application/x-mpegURL m3u8;
                    application/dash+xml mpd;
                    video/MP2T ts;
                    video/mp4 mp4;
                }
                alias /var/media/;
            }
        }
    }

HLS in HTML:

``` sourceCode html
<body>
  <video width="640" height="480" controls autoplay
         src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/play/hls/sintel/index.m3u8">
  </video>
</body>
```

MPEG-DASH in HTML using the
[dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) player:

``` sourceCode html
<script src="http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/dash.all.min.js"></script>

<body>
  <video data-dashjs-player
         width="640" height="480" controls autoplay
         src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/play/dash/sintel/index.mpd">
  </video>
</body>
```

Broadcasting a single-bitrate mp4 file:

``` sourceCode bash
$ ffmpeg -re -i ~/Movies/sintel.mp4 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb
         -c copy -f mpegts http://127.0.0.1:8000/publish/sintel
```

Broadcasting an mp4 file in multiple bitrates. For proper HLS generation
streams should be grouped into MPEG-TS programs with the `-program`
option of `ffmpeg`:

``` sourceCode bash
$ ffmpeg -re -i ~/Movies/sintel.mp4 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb
         -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -map 0:0 -map 0:1
         -c:v:0 copy
         -c:a:0 copy
         -c:v:1 libx264 -b:v:1 100k
         -c:a:1 libfaac -ac:a:1 1 -b:a:1 32k
         -program "st=0:st=1" -program "st=2:st=3"
         -f mpegts http://127.0.0.1:8000/publish/sintel
```
