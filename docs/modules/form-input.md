form-input-nginx-module - NGINX module that reads HTTP POST and PUT request body encoded in "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and parses the arguments into nginx variables.

## Description

This is a nginx module that reads HTTP POST and PUT request body encoded
in "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", and parse the arguments in
request body into nginx variables.

This module depends on the ngx_devel_kit (NDK) module.

## Usage

```nginx
set_form_input $variable;
set_form_input $variable argument;

set_form_input_multi $variable;
set_form_input_multi $variable argument;
```

example:

```nginx
#nginx.conf

location /foo {
    # ensure client_max_body_size == client_body_buffer_size
    client_max_body_size 100k;
    client_body_buffer_size 100k;

    set_form_input $data;    # read "data" field into $data
    set_form_input $foo foo; # read "foo" field into $foo
}

location /bar {
    # ensure client_max_body_size == client_body_buffer_size
    client_max_body_size 1m;
    client_body_buffer_size 1m;

    set_form_input_multi $data; # read all "data" field into $data
    set_form_input_multi $foo data; # read all "data" field into $foo

    array_join ' ' $data; # now $data is an string
    array_join ' ' $foo;  # now $foo is an string
}
```


## Limitations

* ngx_form_input will discard request bodies that are buffered
to disk files. When the client_max_body_size setting is larger than
client_body_buffer_size, request bodies that are larger
than client_body_buffer_size (but no larger than
client_max_body_size) will be buffered to disk files.
So it's important to ensure these two config settings take
the same values to avoid confustion.
