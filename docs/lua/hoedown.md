## Are you ready for the truth?

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami.
This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.
Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book
that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like
they're actually proud of that shit.

## I'm serious as a heart attack

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities
of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the
name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
brothers.
