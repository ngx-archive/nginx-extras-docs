# *socket*: Automatic LuaSocket/cosockets compatibility module


## Installation

### CentOS/RHEL 6, 7, 8 or Amazon Linux 2

![Module Version][badge-version-image]
cosocket/LuaSocket automatic compatibility module for lua-resty modules wanting
to be compatible with plain Lua or OpenResty's `init` context.

The use case for this library is: you are developing a lua-resty module relying
on cosockets, but you want it to also be usable in OpenResty's `init` context
or even in plain Lua. This module aims at always providing your library with
sockets that will be compatible in the current context, saving you time and
effort, and extending LuaSocket's API to match that of cosockets, allowing you
to always write your code as if you were in a cosocket-compatible OpenResty
context.

### Features

* Allows your lua-resty modules to automatically use cosockets/LuaSocket
* Provides `sslhandshake` proxy when using LuaSocket, with a dependency on
  LuaSec
* Does not get blocked to using LuaSocket in further contexts if loaded in the
  ngx_lua `init` (easy mistake to make)
* Memoizes underlying socket methods for performance
* Outputs a warning log for your users when spawning a socket using LuaSocket
  while in OpenResty

### Motivation

The aim of this module is to provide an automatic fallback to LuaSocket when
[ngx_lua]'s cosockets are not available. That is:
- When not used in ngx_lua
- In ngx_lua contexts where cosockets are not supported (`init`, `init_worker`,
etc...)

When falling back to LuaSocket, it provides you with shims for cosocket-only
functions such as `getreusedtimes`, `setkeepalive` etc...

It comes handy when one is developing a module/library that aims at being
either compatible with both ngx_lua **and** plain Lua, **or** in ngx_lua
contexts such as `init`.

### Libraries using it

Here are some concrete examples uses of this module. You can see how we only
write code as if we were constantly in an cosocket-compatible OpenResty
context, which greatly simplifies our work and provides out of the box plain
Lua compatibility.

* [lua-cassandra](https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-cassandra): see how the
  [cassandra](https://github.com/thibaultcha/lua-cassandra/blob/master/lib/cassandra/init.lua)
  module is compatible in both OpenResty and plain Lua with no efforts or
  special code paths distinguishing cosockets and LuaSocket.

### Important note

The use of LuaSocket inside ngx_lua is **very strongly** discouraged due to its
blocking nature. However, it is fine to use it in the `init` context where
blocking is not considered harmful.

In the future, only the `init` phase will allow falling back to LuaSocket.

It currently only support TCP sockets.

## Usage

All of the available functions follow the same prototype as the cosocket API,
allowing this example to run in any ngx_lua context or outside ngx_lua
altogether:
```lua
local socket = require 'resty.socket'
local sock = socket.tcp()

getmetatable(sock) == socket.luasocket_mt ---> true/false depending on underlying socket

sock:settimeout(1000) ---> 1000ms translated to 1s if LuaSocket

sock:getreusedtimes(...) ---> 0 if LuaSocket

sock:setkeepalive(...) ---> calls close() if LuaSocket

sock:sslhandshake(...) ---> LuaSec dependency if LuaSocket
```

As such, one can write a module relying on TCP sockets such as:
```lua
local socket = require 'resty.socket'

local _M = {}

function _M.new()
  local sock = socket.tcp() -- similar to ngx.socket.tcp()

  return setmetatable({
    sock = sock
  }, {__index = _M})
end

function _M:connect(host, port)
  local ok, err = self.sock:connect(host, port)
  if not ok then
    return nil, err
  end

  local times, err = self.sock:getreusedtimes() -- cosocket API
  if not times then
    return nil, err
  elseif times == 0 then
    -- handle connection
  end
end

return _M
```

The user of such a module could use it in contexts with cosocket support, or
in the `init` phase of ngx_lua, with little effort from the developer.
