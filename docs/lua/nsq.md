lua-resty-nsq - Lua nsq client driver for the ngx_lua based on the cosocket API

## Status

This library is developing.

## Description

This Lua library is a NSQ client driver for the ngx_lua nginx module:

This Lua library takes advantage of ngx_lua's cosocket API, which ensures
100% nonblocking behavior.

## Synopsis

```lua
    server {
        location /test {
            content_by_lua_block {
                local config = {
                    read_timeout = 3,
                    heartbeat = 1,
                }
                local producer = require "resty.nsq.producer"
                local consumer = require "resty.nsq.consumer"

                local cons = consumer:new()
                local prod = producer:new()

                local ok, err = cons:connect("127.0.0.1", 4150, config)
                if not ok then
                    ngx.say("failed to connect: ", err)
                    return
                end

                local ok, err = prod:connect("127.0.0.1", 4150)
                if not ok then
                    ngx.say("failed to connect: ", err)
                    return
                end

                ok, err = prod:pub("new_topic", "hellow world!")
                if not ok then
                    ngx.say("failed to pub: ", err)
                    return
                end

                ok, err = prod:close()
                if not ok then
                    ngx.say("failed to close: ", err)
                    return
                end

                ok, err = cons:sub("new_topic", "new_channel")
                if not ok then
                    ngx.say("failed to sub: ", err)
                    return
                end

                local function read(c)
                    c:rdy(10)
                    local ret = cons:message()
                    ngx.say("sub success: ", require("cjson").encode(ret))
                end

                local co = ngx.thread.spawn(read, cons) -- read message in new thread
                ngx.thread.wait(co)

                ok, err = cons:close()
                if not ok then
                    ngx.say("failed to close: ", err)
                    return
                end
            }
        }
    }
